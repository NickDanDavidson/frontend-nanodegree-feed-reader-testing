#Testing a Feed Reader Application with Jasmine

##About the Project

In this project I was given a feed reading application and was tasked with writing Jasmine tests to test various functionality:

- Are the RSS feeds to be loaded properly formatted?
- Is the hidden (off-screen) menu hidden by default?
- Does the menu then change visibility when clicked?
- Are the initial feeds loaded when the feed reader makes its first call?
- Does loading another feed actually change the content on the page?

##How to Run the Project

- Open the [live page](https://nickdandavidson.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feed-reader-testing) in the browser of your choice.
- At the bottom of the page, you should see the results of the tests I wrote.
- Open jasmine/spec/feedreader.js and read through the code and comments.
- Enjoy!
