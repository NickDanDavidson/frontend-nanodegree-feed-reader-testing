#Testing a Feed Reader Application with Jasmine

##About the Project

In this project I was given a feed reading application and was tasked with writing Jasmine tests to test various functionality:

- Are the RSS feeds to be loaded properly formatted?
- Is the hidden (off-screen) menu hidden by default?
- Does the menu then change visibility when clicked?
- Are the initial feeds loaded when the feed reader makes its first call?
- Does loading another feed actually change the content on the page?
